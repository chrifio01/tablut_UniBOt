This module manages the gameplay for the Tablut game, including player actions,
game state management, and validation of moves.

It integrates different utility classes and functions:
- `State` for representing and manipulating the game state.
- `Action` for representing a player's move.
- `strp_state` and `strp_square` for converting state and square string representations.
- `AbstractPlayer` for defining the interface for player classes.

Imports:
    - State, strp_state: For handling and parsing the game state.
    - Action, strf_square, strp_square, Piece, Color: 
        Game-specific utilities for actions, board parsing, and game piece management.
    - AbstractPlayer: The base class for creating player agents.
